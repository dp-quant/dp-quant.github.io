{"data":{"authorJson":{"fullName":"Dmytro Podoprosvietov aka `Middle Infinity Fossil`","displayName":"Dmytro Podoprosvietov","summary":"Hi there! I'm a software engineer (since 2008) who is interested in web development, high-load systems, data analysis, and a lot of other cool things, IT and open-source enthusiast. Today I’m focusing on Python and Golang development as a platform engineer, focusing on AWS tech stack and serverless solutions. On the other side, I'm looking for new great stuff from the JavaScript world(ReactJS, NodeJs, GatsbyJS, etc). Generally, I was starting my “professional” life as a dude that created HTML templates with tables and images. But today, I'm a dedicated solution engineer, platform architect, and product technical leader on our teams.","roles":["Software Engineer","Geek","Hacker","Philosopher","Dad","Gamer"],"positions":["Software Engineer","Platform/System Architect","DevOps Engineer","Product Technical Manager"],"technologies":["python","django","flask","aiohttp","fastapi","golang","javascript","reactjs","aws","serverless","mysql","postgresql","mongodb","aws dynamodb","aws","aws lambda","ansible","terraform","docker","git"],"current":{"workplace":{"name":"Sprinterra","position":"Senior Software Engineer/System Architect"}},"address":{"city":"Kyiv","country":"Ukraine"},"hobbies":["Music","Drums","Robotics","Digital Marketing","Space and Astronomy","Canoeing","Photography"],"contacts":{"email":"erlrange@gmail.com"},"education":[{"id":"zcpu","school":"Zaporizhzhia Classic Private University","speciality":"Computer Science, Management ","degree":"Masters","startDate":"2007","endDate":"2010"},{"id":"zec","school":"Zaporizhzhian Electrical Collage","speciality":" Software Engineering, Computer Science","degree":"Bachelor","startDate":"2000","endDate":"2004"}],"programming_languages":[{"name":"Python","level":100},{"name":"JavaScript","level":100},{"name":"Go","level":70}],"languages":[{"name":"English","level":80},{"name":"Ukrainian","level":100},{"name":"Spanish","level":20}],"tech_groups":["Python, Django, FastAPI, aiohttp","JavaScript, React, Vue, NodeJs","PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, AWS DynamoDB","AWS, Serverless, Ansible, Terraform, Docker","Go and Microservices"],"interests_groups":["Open Source","UI/UX Design","Security and Optimizations","Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence","No/Low Code Solutions"]},"careerJson":{"path":[{"id":"sprinterra","organization":"Sprinterra","position":["Software Architect","Senior Software Engineer","Technical Product Manager"],"responsibilities":["Take a part in all phases of Software Development Life Cycle including requirements gathering, designing, implementing, testing, and maintenance support","Manage the planning of work tasks, setting clear objectives, recognizing issues, monitoring progress, and reporting status of work tasks to the project manager","Design and implemented scalable, secure cloud architecture","Investigate and resolve performance and scalability issues","Follow HIPAA and PHI compliance"],"startDate":"May 2019","technologies":["python","django","django rest framework","mysql","mongodb","celery","twilio","firebase","aws","scikit-learn","rabbitmq","reactjs","docker"],"url":"https://www.sprinterra.com/","endDate":"Current","description":""},{"id":"hypertrack","organization":"HyperTrack","position":["Senior Software Engineer"],"responsibilities":["Full Stack Development - backend/frontend(web)/mobile(RN SDK/Views)","Application code design and development","Issues troubleshooting and resolution","Investigate and resolve performance and scalability issues","Customer support/coaching"],"startDate":"Jul 2019","technologies":["python","postgresql","aws dynamodb","aws kinesis","aws cloud formation","aws ecs","serverless","reactjs","leaflet","reactnative","terraform"],"url":"https://hypertrack.com/","endDate":"Jan 2020","description":"Location tracking and intelligence as a service based on distributed serverless AWS architecture"},{"id":"simplelife","organization":"Simple Life","position":["Senior Software Engineer"],"responsibilities":["Full Stack Development - backend/frontend(web)","Application code design and development","Issues troubleshooting and resolution","Investigate and resolve performance and scalability issues"],"startDate":"Apr 2017","technologies":["python","django","django rest framework","postgresql","aws dynamodb","rabbitmq","celery","splunk","ansible","docker","redis","jenkins","twilio","javascript","vuejs"],"url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/still-simple-inc.-dba-simple-life/about/","endDate":"Aug 2019","description":"Simple Life is a California-based insurance platform on a mission to make the insurance enrollment and education process understandable once and for all.
